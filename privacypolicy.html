    "services" in this policy.</p>

<p>References to "data" in this Privacy Policy will refer to whatever data you use our services to collect, whether it
    be survey responses, data collected in a form, or data inserted on a site hosted by us – it’s all your data!
    Reference to personal information or just information, means information about you personally that we collect or for
    which we act as custodian.</p>

<p>If you want to identify your data controller please see the "Who is my data controller" section below.</p>

<h1>2. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h1>

<h2>2.1 Who are "you"?</h2>
<p>We refer to "you" a lot in this Privacy Policy. To better understand what information is most relevant to you, see
    the following useful definitions.</p>

<p>CREATORS - You hold an account within a QUIZZORY service and you either directly create surveys, forms,

<h2>Device and browser data.</h2>
<p>We collect information from the device and application you use to access our services. Device data mainly means your

    browser type. If you are on a mobile device we also collect the FCMID for that device.</p>

<h2>Information from page tags.</h2>
<p>We use first party and third party cookies and tracking services that employ cookies and page tags (also known as web
    beacons) to collect data about visitors to our websites. This data includes usage and user statistics. Emails sent
    by QUIZZORY or by users through our services also include page tags that allow the sender to collect information
    about who opened those emails and clicked on links in them.</p>

<h2>Log Data.</h2>
<p>Like most websites today, our web servers keep log files that record data each time a device accesses those servers.
    The log files contain data about the nature of each access, internet service providers, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system versions, device type
    and timestamps.</p>
<h2>Referral information.</h2>

    and financial information corresponding to your selected method of payment (e.g. a credit card number and expiration
    date or a bank account number). If you provide a billing address, we will regard that as the location of the account
    holder to determine which QUIZZORY entity with whom you contract and the sales tax, if applicable, to be applied
    to your purchase.</p>

<h2>Account settings.</h2>

<p>Use of survey responses (QUIZZORY surveys)</p>

<p>In general survey responses to QUIZZORY surveys are controlled and managed by the Creator (the person who sent or
    deployed that survey). In those instances QUIZZORY is only processing those responses on behalf of the
    Creator.</p>

<p>Creator and Respondent trust is paramount to everything we do and so when we do use data about Respondents, we
    put</p>
<p>Creators and Respondents first. When we do analysis of response data we only do so once we have ensured the anonymity
    of
    individual respondents (by aggregating and anonymizing the data).</p>

<p>Our goal is to improve the user experience across QUIZZORY survey services while maintaining the confidentiality
    and
    privacy of responses.</p>

    recommendations to increase response rates.</p>

<h1>4. INFORMATION YOU SHARE</h1>
<p>Many of our services let you share information with others. Remember that when you share information publicly, it can
    be
    indexable by search engines. Our services provide you with different options on sharing and deleting your content
    but we
    cannot delete content from search engines so you need to be careful about information you make public.</p>

<h1>5. INFORMATION WE SHARE</h1>

<p>We do not share your information or data with third parties outside QUIZZORY except in the following limited
    circumstances:</p>

<p>If you are a Creator that is part of a team plan or Enterprise plan using QUIZZORY, your account information and
    data
    will be shared with the primary administrator(s) and your survey data may also be visible to other members in your
    team
    with whom you share your surveys or with whom you collaborate. Your administrator(s) will be able to view your
    account
    data, suspend, transfer or terminate your account or restrict your settings. Please refer to your organization’s
    internal policies if you have questions about this.</p>

<p>If your organization has purchased an account and you are using an email address on a domain owned by your employer
    or
    organization linked to your individual account, you may be asked to migrate to that purchased Account and your email
    address, name and account data will subsequently be visible to the primary administrator for that account once you
    have
    been migrated. You may be notified in advance of this migration and given an opportunity to change the email address
    linked to your account if you are not using your account for business purposes.</p>

    enforce applicable policies, including investigation of potential violations.
    detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.

    any
    of these events.</p>

    that
    support Display Advertising, including re-targeting. Visitors to our websites may opt out of certain types of Google
    Analytics tracking, customize the Google Display Network ads by using the Google Ad Preferences Manager and learn
    more

<h1>6. DATA RETENTION</h1>

    control
    the time periods for which you retain this data. There are controls in your account where you can delete data at the

    the
    Creator how long your responses will be stored in QUIZZORY services.</p>
