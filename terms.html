        <h4 id="last_modified">Last Modified: September 17, 2020 </h4>
        <h2 class="content_title">Welcome to Quizzory !</h2>
        <p>Thanks for using our products and services (“Services”). The Services are provided by Quizzory
            (“Quizzory”), located at 204 KaivalyaDham Apartments, Kanha Shanti Vanam, Renga Reddy (District),
            Telangana (State), India - 509325.</p>
        <p>By using our Services, you are agreeing to these terms. Please read them carefully.</p>
        <p>Our Services are very diverse, so sometimes additional terms or product requirements (including age
            requirements) may apply. Additional terms will be available with the relevant Services, and those additional
            terms become part of your agreement with us if you use those Services.</p>

        <h2 class="content_title">Using our Services</h2>
        <p>You must follow any policies made available to you within the Services.</p>
        <p>Don’t misuse our Services. For example, don’t interfere with our Services or try to access them using a
            method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You may use our Services only as
            permitted by law, including applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations. We may suspend or
            stop providing our Services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are
            investigating suspected misconduct.</p>
        <p>Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the
            content you access. You may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or
            are otherwise permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in
            our Services. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.</p>
        <p>Our Services display some content that is not Quizzory’s. This content is the sole responsibility of the
            entity that makes it available. We may review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our
            policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or
            the law. But that does not necessarily mean that we review content, so please don’t assume that we do.</p>
        <p>In connection with your use of the Services, we may send you service announcements, administrative messages,
            and other information. You may opt out of some of those communications.</p>
        <p>Some of our Services are available on mobile devices. Do not use such Services in a way that distracts you
            and prevents you from obeying traffic or safety laws.</p>

        <h2 class="content_title">Your Quizzory Account</h2>
        <p>You may need a Quizzory Account in order to use our Services. You may create your own Quizzory Account,
            or your Quizzory Account may be assigned to you by an administrator, such as your employer or educational
            institution. If you are using a Quizzory Account assigned to you by an administrator, different or
            additional terms may apply and your administrator may be able to access or disable your account.</p>
        <p> You are responsible for the activity that happens on or through your Quizzory Account. If you learn of any unauthorized use of <your></your> Quizzory Account,
            follow these instructions.</p>

        <h2 class="content_title">Privacy and Copyright Protection</h2>
        <p>Quizzory’s privacy policies explain how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use
            our Services. By using our Services, you agree that Quizzory can use such data in accordance with our
            privacy policies.</p>
        <p>We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminate accounts of repeat infringers according
            to the process set out in the Indian Copyright Law. The Copyright Act 1957 (as amended by the Copyright
            Amendment Act 2012)</p>
        <p>We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online. If you think
            somebody is violating your copyrights and want to notify us, you can report us via abuse report form which
            is available in the bottom of form page.</p>

        <h2 class="content_title">Your Content in our Services</h2>
        <p>Some of our Services allow you to upload, submit, store, send or receive content. You retain ownership of any
            intellectual property rights that you hold in that content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours.</p>
        <p>When you upload, submit, store, send or receive content to or through our Services, you give Quizzory (and
            those we work with) a worldwide license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works
            (such as those resulting from translations, adaptations or other changes we make so that your content works
            better with our Services), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such
            content. The rights you grant in this license are for the limited purpose of operating, promoting, and
            improving our Services, and to develop new ones. This license continues even if you stop using our Services.
            Some Services may offer you ways to access and remove content that has been provided to that Service. Also,
            in some of our Services, there are terms or settings that narrow the scope of our use of the content
            submitted in those Services. Make sure you have the necessary rights to grant us this license for any
            content that you submit to our Services.</p>
        <p>Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product
            features, such as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection. This
            analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.</p>
        <P>If you have a Quizzory Account, we may display your Profile name, Profile photo, and actions you take on
            Quizzory or on third-party applications connected to your Quizzory Account in our Services, including
            displaying in ads and other commercial contexts. We will respect the choices you make to limit sharing or
            visibility settings in your Quizzory Account.</P>
        <p>You can find more information about how Quizzory uses and stores content in the privacy policy or
            additional terms for particular Services. If you submit feedback or suggestions about our Services, we may
            use your feedback or suggestions without obligation to you.</p>

        <h2 class="content_title">About Software in our Services</h2>
        <p>When a Service requires or includes downloadable software, this software may update automatically on your
            device once a new version or feature is available. Some Services may let you adjust your automatic update
            settings.</p>
        <p>Quizzory gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use
            the software provided to you by Quizzory as part of the Services. This license is for the sole purpose of
            enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by Quizzory, in the manner
            permitted by these terms. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Services or
            included software, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software,
            unless laws prohibit those restrictions or you have our written permission.</p>
        <p>Open source software is important to us. Some software used in our Services may be offered under an open
            source license that we will make available to you. There may be provisions in the open source license that
            expressly override some of these terms.</p>

        <h2 class="content_title">Modifying and Terminating our Services</h2>
        <p>We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or remove functionalities or features, and
            we may suspend or stop a Service altogether.</p>
        <p>You can stop using our Services at any time, although we’ll be sorry to see you go. Quizzory may also stop
            providing Services to you, or add or create new limits to our Services at any time.</p>
        <p>We believe that you own your data and preserving your access to such data is important. If we discontinue a
            Service, where reasonably possible, we will give you reasonable advance notice and a chance to get
            information out of that Service.</p>

        <h2 class="content_title">Our Warranties and Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>We provide our Services using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care and we hope that you will
            enjoy using them. But there are certain things that we don’t promise about our Services.</p>
        <p>Other than as expressly set out in these terms or additional terms, neither Quizzory nor its suppliers or
            distributors make any specific promises about the Services. For example, we don’t make any commitments about
            the content within the Services, the specific functions of the Services, or their reliability, availability,
            or ability to meet your needs. We provide the Services “as is”.</p>
        <p>Some jurisdictions provide for certain warranties, like the implied warranty of merchantability, fitness for
            a particular purpose and non-infringement. To the extent permitted by law, we exclude all warranties.</p>

        <h2 class="content_title">Liability for our Services</h2>
        <p>When permitted by law, Quizzory will not be responsible for lost profits, revenues, or data, financial
            losses or indirect, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages.</p>
        <p>To the extent permitted by law, the total liability of Quizzory for any claims under these terms,
            including for any implied warranties, is limited to the amount you paid us to use the Services (or, if we
            choose, to supplying you the Services again).</p>
        <p>In all cases, Quizzory will not be liable for any loss or damage that is not reasonably foreseeable.</p>

        <h2 class="content_title">Business uses of our Services</h2>
        <p>If you are using our Services on behalf of a business, that business accepts these terms. It will hold
            harmless and indemnify Quizzory and its employees from any claim, suit or action arising from or related
            to the use of the Services or violation of these terms, including any liability or expense arising from
            claims, losses, damages, suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys’ fees.</p>

        <h2 class="content_title">About these Terms</h2>
        <p>We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect changes to
            the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly. We’ll post notice of
            modifications to these terms on this page. We’ll post notice of modified additional terms in the applicable
            Service. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after
            they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons
            will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should
            discontinue your use of that Service.</p>
        <p>If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will control for
            that conflict.</p>
        <p>These terms control the relationship between Quizzory and you. They do not create any third party
            beneficiary rights.</p>
        <p>If you do not comply with these terms, and we don’t take action right away, this doesn’t mean that we are
            giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).</p>
        <p>If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.</p>
        <h3>Thank You!</h3>
